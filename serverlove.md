Dedicated to Celso Rodrigues

My love is like a broken server
Calling through the night
We need a new event observer
To keep the errors in our sight

My love is like a broken server
Blocking engineers
Who code with such demonic fervour
Yet cannot see their work appear

My love is like a broken server
Costing lots of money
Will our business need a merger
Because of my love, my honey

My love is like a broken server
Never scaled up
Weâ€™d better get a life preserver
Or so they say in standup
