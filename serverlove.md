Dedicated to Celso Rodrigues

My love is like a broken server<br>
Calling through the night<br>
We need a new event observer<br>
To keep the errors in our sight<br>

My love is like a broken server<br>
Blocking engineers<br>
Who code with such demonic fervour<br>
Yet cannot see their work appear<br>

My love is like a broken server<br>
Costing lots of money<br>
Will our business need a merger<br>
Because of my love, my honey<br>

My love is like a broken server<br>
Never scaled up<br>
Weâ€™d better get a life preserver<br>
Or so they say in standup<br>
